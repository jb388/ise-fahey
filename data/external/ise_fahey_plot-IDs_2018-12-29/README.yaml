    Hi folks,



    If you decide to run a few samples as a trial, I would recommend the following: one each from the following plots – plots 1, 4, 7 and 9. If you want to do eight, then you could run both a “min” and an “org” from each of these plots, choosing among the three replicates arbitrarily. Below I explain the project briefly. The attached file [ISE plots.xlsx] identifies the plots by treatment.



    We created ice storms on a series of plots by spraying the canopy of mature forest plots with water during mid-winter of 2016. The treatments successfully damaged the canopies of the trees. The design included two replicate plots for each of four treatments: low, mid, high and mid 2x designating different levels of ice. “2x” plots were treated in two successive years, 2016 and 2017.



    The fine root samples are from ingrowth cores;  “org” are from forest floor and “min” from mineral soil. The idea is that canopy damage and subsequent recovery resulted in reduced C supply and increased C demand, so that trees would need to draw on older C reserves to build fine roots following the treatment. The set that was run earlier were from the first year post-treatment (2016). The data were noisy either or both because of contamination with roots from outside the cores or limited response in the first year. The current set is from the second year (2017). These samples certainly do not include any “contamination”. The vials include three replicates from each plot – these are pooled from among nine field replicate ingrowth cores for each plot. The four plots I selected for a trial are two reference plots (4,7) a high plot (9) and a 2x plot (1). If these do not show any difference in C age, then it would probably be futile to proceed further unless we wish to conclusively disprove the hypothesis.



    I have also included a bunch of wood samples collected from white ash trees at HBEF. These are labelled by year. The cores were sectioned by annual rings (ash has clear rings and rapid growth). Sue suggested that these might be helpful for purposes of calibrating C age for the region.
