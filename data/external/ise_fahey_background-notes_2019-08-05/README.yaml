  - email from T. Fahey:
    These samples are from ingrowth cores collected in fall 2017 – so roots that grew in the summer of 2017. It seems you ran samples from three treatments – High, Mid2X and control – two replicate plots and three replicate samples for each plot. The data look interesting if only marginally significant. One of the two Mid plots looks elevated but the other clearly not. The high plots look convincing to me. Jeff should have the sectioned tree ring samples from ash trees that I collected in summer 2017.

    If you decide to run any additional root samples, I would suggest running samples from plots 2 and 3 (presumably only the mineral samples). The damage from the ice storm simulation differed among replicates for each treatment. Plot 3 is a “mid” plot that was more heavily damaged than either plot 1 or 8. Plot 2 is a “light” plot that was minimally damaged, closer to the controls. Thus, if we used one of our damage indices (e.g. change in LAI) and included these two plots we might be able to demonstrate a relationship between “damage” and root 14C (if such exists) – plots 2 and 3 would give us more samples along the range of damage. Of course it might also give us noise!

    Couple of additional notes. Our colleague, Paul Schaberg, has samples for non-structural carbohydrates that are still in process. He thinks the 2017 samples will be finished during this fall sometime. He also measures callous growth/wound repair on the trees and has those data available – I haven’t seen them. I also have 2018 root ingrowth samples that are stored at Cornell.
