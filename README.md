Experimental data from simulated ice storm in a northern hardwood forest

This project contains radiocarbon measurements made on fine roots collected from in-growth cores at Arnot Forest (NY, USA) following a simulated ice storm. Principal investigator is Prof. Tim Fahey, department of Natural Resources, Cornell University.

Source data is located in the "data" directory; details on experimental setup and methods are available in the directory [ise_fahey_background-notes_2019-08-05](data/external/ise_fahey_background-notes_2019-08-05).
